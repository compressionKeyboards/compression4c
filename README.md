## Downloads
feel free to dig around in my working files in the repo :) but if you just want to order a PCB or print a case, checkout the releases tab.

## TODO
Fusion and STEP files will be added soon, I'm just cleaning them up a bit. Also, display cover files are not final, and just a few dimensions will be tweaked in an upcoming release.
